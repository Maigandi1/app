# Smart Auto Booking App

This project is a simple booking app built with React. It allows users to:
- View available slots
- Fill out a booking form
- Submit and view booking details dynamically

## Features
- React-based frontend
- Form validation and error handling
- Clean and intuitive UI
- Modular component structure

## Project Structure
- `src/`: All source files (components, styles, etc.)
- `App.js`: Main application logic
- `BookingForm.js`: Form component for booking
- `BookingList.js`: Displays submitted bookings

## Why I Made These Choices
- **React** was chosen for its speed, reusability, and real-time UI updating capabilities.
- I kept the project **simple and clean** to focus on the core functionalities.
- Used **state management via hooks** (like `useState`) for efficient handling of form and list data.
